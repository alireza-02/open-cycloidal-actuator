# Recommended Print Settings

This document provides the recommended 3D printing settings for the different components of the actuator.

## PETG Cycloidal Components

These settings are for the cycloidal discs and the output ring gear.

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Layer height | 0.2mm | Balance between detail and print time |
| Infill | 25% | Sufficient strength with material efficiency |
| Infill pattern | Cubic | Optimal strength distribution |
| Nozzle temperature | 240째C | Better layer adhesion |
| Bed temperature | 70째C | Improved adhesion, reduced warping |
| Print speed | 60mm/s | Balanced speed for good quality |
| Cooling | 75% | Moderate cooling for dimensional stability |
| Print orientation | Horizontal | Ensures load is distributed across layers |

## PLA+ Housing Components

These settings are for the housing components of the actuator.

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Layer height | 0.2mm | Standard resolution |
| Infill | 25% | Sufficient for structural integrity |
| Infill pattern | Cubic | Good strength-to-weight ratio |
| Nozzle temperature | 215째C | Manufacturer recommended |
| Bed temperature | 60째C | Standard for PLA+ |
| Print speed | 120mm/s | Faster prints for larger components |
| Cooling | 75% | Controlled cooling for dimensional accuracy |
